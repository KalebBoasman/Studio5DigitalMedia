			<h3>Review Questions</h3>

			<div>
				<!--ordered list made sense as the parent element to order the questions.-->
				<ol>
					<li>
						What genre of creative software do you believe it belongs to?
						<div>I believe the genre of this software would be a sandbox.</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						List three other examples of software in this genre
						<div>
							<ul>
								<li>Powder tool</li>
								<li>People Playground</li>
								<li>Universe Sandbox</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						List the program's interactive features/mechanics (one sentence max
						explanation per feature/mechanic)
						<div>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Material select panel lets you pick what to spawn into the sandbox.
								</li>
								<li>
									Clicking within the main frame will spawn whatever you currently have
									selected.
								</li>
								<li>
									The creatures and materials spawned into the world will interact with
									each other based on their types.
								</li>
								<li>A daylight cycle changes the behaviour of some creatures.</li>
								<li>
									The fast forward button increasest the speed at which interactions
									occur and at which the day/night cycle progresses.
								</li>
								<li>
									A gauge on the main panel measures the CO2 and O2 content of the
									simulation.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						What features/mechanics indicate its genre by aligning with its
						conventions?
						<div>
							The ability to infinitely spawn in whatever material you choose and the
							fact that they all interact independently. There is also no end goal or
							score.
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						What features/mechanics are novel for its genre?
						<div>
							The ability to fast forward through time and select from a large variety
							of materials/creatures/items.
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						What features/mechanics common to its genre are missing or might be added?
						<div>
							The ability to pause the simulation and the ability to export/import
							simulation states.
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						What context, community or niche is it primarily aimed at and what
						indicates this?
						<div>
							It is primarily aimed at marine enthusiasts as the software is built
							around balancing the CO2 and O2 levels of a marine environment.
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						What did you find annoying and/or boring about interacting with it?
						<div>
							There was a fairly small amount of materials/creatures to select from and
							generally a problem had a direct solution which didnt allow for much
							play.
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						What did you find enjoyable about interacting with it?
						<div>
							The visual style is gorgeous, the CO2 and O2 gauge adds feedback to the
							experience on whether you're doing good and the shifting day/night cycle
							that changed behaviours stopped you from striking a perfect balance and
							stagnating.
						</div>
